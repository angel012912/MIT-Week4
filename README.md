Porpouse: The porpouse during this week was to learn about how can we control arrays.

The main project of this repo is the animation of the character pac-man that will be walking across the screen and when hits the border it will reverse its direction.

In this repositorie is stored all the excercises I did during the week 4 for the MIT xPro certificate of programming
